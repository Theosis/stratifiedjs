This changelog lists the most prominent, developer-visible changes in each release.

## Version 0.15:

 * modules can now be made executable. use `if (require.main === module) { ... }` to run
   additional code when your module is being run (rather than just imported).

 * process.ARGV retains the same number of arguments as it does for native nodejs programs
   (we used to start script arguments from argv[1], but they now start from argv[2] just like in nodejs.
   Note that the new `sys::argv` function is now the recommended way of accessing script arguments.

 * the two-part ternary syntax: `x ? y` is now shorthand for `x ? y : undefined`.

 * logging methods now print to `stderr` by default

 * the test runner now produces string diffs between expected and actual values

 * string::split now allows regular expression separators, and works consistently cross-browser
   even if String.prototype.split() is buggy.

 * url.parse() no longer has a `queryKey` property. It has been
   replaced with the `params()` method, which URL-decodes all keys
   and values.

 * new modules:

   * sjs:regexp
   * sjs:bundle - executable module for bundling multiple sjs modules into a single .js file
   * sjs:compile/doc - executable module for generating documentation indexes

 * new functions:

   * sequence::intersperse
   * string::unindent
   * string::padLeft
   * string::padRight
   * sys::argv()
   * require.hubs.addDefault(hub)
   * require.hubs.defined(prefix)
